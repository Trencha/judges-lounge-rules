1.
Be respectful at all times
Disrespect among members will NOT be tolerated. This includes comments such as “just read the card” and any other answers that belittle or make fun of people for asking questions that you think are basic.

2.
Discussion of rules, mechanics, and policies only
This space is not for trading, buying/selling of cards, deck discussion, memes etc. Ruling questions about legacy formats (e.g. goat) are allowed, but we cannot vouch for any answers you may receive.

3.
This group is NOT an official Yu-Gi-Oh! group
This group is not affiliated with Konami or any official resources and as such is not an official source for rulings nor should you think of it as such.

4.
Do not ask about unreleased cards
You are welcome to ask about any card that has been officially released in the OCG or that we have official TCG text for. Otherwise, please refrain from asking about unreleased cards.

5.
We do not support unlicensed dueling simulators
You can mention simulators and post screenshots if it is relevant, but otherwise avoid discussing them. Do not post bug reports or ask for a judge to come and answer your judge call.

6.
Do not block moderators and admins
Blocking moderators and admins prevents us from notifying you about rules you may have broken. If you are found to have blocked a moderator or admin, you will be muted and then after a 7 day period if the block is still in place you will be removed from the group.

7.
Respect the authority of moderators and admins
Our admin staff endeavour to be unbiased and professional. In the case of a dispute with any admin staff, please contact a different admin to voice your concerns. Do not make a group post about it.

8.
Do not flood our posts with irrelevant discussion
Stay on topic and do not bring drama to this group. Keep personal conversations and banter to a minimum. Disputes that originated in other groups should be settled there.

9.
Do not post videos or go live in our group
It is too time consuming for the people answering questions at their leisure to have to sit through a video of you explaining the problem. Simply ask your question and include a picture if it helps.

10.
No advertising/recruitment without approval
With the exception of judge calls for sanctioned events, advertising/recruitment must first be approved the admin staff. Feel free to message staff with inquiries and we will review them case-by-case.
